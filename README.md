## 🚀 About Me
I am a **Systems & Security Engineer** in training, currently working as a Security Apprentice at **ORTSOC** (The Nation's First Cyber Security Teaching Hospital). My passion lies in the intersection of **low-level software** (C/Assembly), **networking protocols**, and **defensive security**. I am currently targeting roles in Embedded Systems and Network Security.

## 📂 Featured Engineering Projects

### 🐚 [Smallsh: Custom Linux Shell (C)](https://github.com/jadencao)
*A custom shell implementation demonstrating low-level OS control.*
* **Process Management:** Implemented `fork()`, `exec()`, and `waitpid()` to manage foreground and background processes.
* **Signal Handling:** Engineered custom signal handlers (SIGINT, SIGTSTP) to manage shell behavior safely.
* **I/O Redirection:** Manipulated file descriptors (`dup2`) to support input/output redirection (`<`, `>`) for executed commands.
* **Tech Stack:** C, Linux API, Makefiles.

### 📡 [Reliable Data Transfer Simulator (C++)](https://github.com/jadencao/CS372-Networks)
*Designed a custom transport-layer protocol to ensure reliable delivery over an unreliable network.*
* Implemented **Stop-and-Wait** logic using UDP sockets to simulate TCP reliability.
* Engineered packet **checksumming**, **sequence numbering**, and **retransmission timers** to handle data corruption and loss.
* Simulated network jitter and packet drops to stress-test protocol robustness.

### 🛡️ [RFC 6238 MFA Authenticator (Python)](https://github.com/jadencao/CS370-Security)
*Developed a Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) generator compliant with RFC 6238.*
* Implemented **HMAC-SHA1** cryptographic hashing for secure token generation.
* Built **QR code provisioning** compatible with Google Authenticator.
* Analyzed trade-offs between security and usability in 2FA implementations.

### ⚙️ [x86 Architecture & Assembly Logic (MASM)](https://github.com/jadencao)
*Systems programming in x86 Assembly to understand computer architecture fundamentals.*
* Managed the **system stack** manually (push/pop) for procedure calls and parameter passing.
* Manipulated CPU **registers** and memory addressing for optimized data processing.
* Wrote custom macros for low-level I/O handling.
