## 🚀 About Me
I am a **Systems & Security Engineer** in training, currently working as a Security Apprentice at **ORTSOC** (The Nation's First Cyber Security Teaching Hospital). My passion lies in the intersection of **low-level software** (C/Assembly), **networking protocols**, and **defensive security**. I am currently targeting roles in Embedded Systems and Network Security.

## 📂 Featured Engineering Projects

### 📡 [Reliable Data Transfer Simulator (C++)](https://github.com/jadencao/CS372-Networks)
*Designed a custom transport-layer protocol to ensure reliable delivery over an unreliable network.*
* Implemented **Stop-and-Wait** logic using UDP sockets.
* Engineered packet **checksumming**, **sequence numbering**, and **retransmission timers** to handle data corruption and loss.
* Simulated network jitter and packet drops to stress-test protocol robustness.

### 🛡️ [RFC 6238 MFA Authenticator (Python)](https://github.com/jadencao/CS370-Security)
*Developed a Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) generator compliant with RFC 6238.*
* Implemented **HMAC-SHA1** cryptographic hashing for secure token generation.
* Built **QR code provisioning** compatible with Google Authenticator.
* Analyzed trade-offs between security and usability in 2FA implementations.

### ⚙️ [Low-Level Procedures & Macros (x86 MASM)](https://github.com/jadencao/CS271-MASM)
*Systems programming in x86 Assembly to understand computer architecture fundamentals.*
* Managed the **system stack** manually (push/pop) for procedure calls and parameter passing.
* Manipulated CPU **registers** and memory addressing for optimized data processing.
* Wrote custom macros for low-level I/O handling.

### 🕵️ [Network Diagnostics & Traceroute (Python)](https://github.com/jadencao/jadencao)
*Built a custom traceroute utility using raw sockets.*
* Manipulated **IP TTL (Time-to-Live)** fields to map network hops.
* Parsed **ICMP "Time Exceeded"** responses to calculate Round-Trip Time (RTT) for each node.
