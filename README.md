- **Reliable Data Transfer Simulator (C++):** Implemented a Stop-and-Wait transport protocol with checksums, retransmissions, and timeouts for reliable delivery over an unreliable channel.

### Security
- **Bloom Filter Password Detector (C/Python):** Created a probabilistic password blacklist checker tested on rockyou.txt; analyzed false positive trade-offs and cybersecurity applications.
- **OTP/TOTP Authenticator (Python):** Developed an RFC 6238-based one-time password generator with QR provisioning for Google Authenticator; applied secure key management concepts.
- **DVWA Exploitation Labs:** Conducted hands-on penetration testing (XSS, SQLi), documented findings and best practices.

### Databases & Web Development
- **CRUD Web App (JavaScript/Node/MySQL):** Designed a full-stack app integrating MySQL database with REST APIs for dynamic data management and secure authentication.  
  [Repo Link](https://github.com/jadencao/CS-340-Project)
- **SQL Experience:** Built normalized relational schemas, optimized queries, implemented JOINs, aggregation, and ensured data integrity using MySQL Workbench and XAMPP.

### Additional Coursework
- **Operating Systems:** Implemented multi-threaded producer-consumer counters in C, focusing on concurrency and resource management.
- **Collaboration:** Led and contributed to group-based OSU CS projects (2–4 peers), practicing documentation, code review, and sprint planning.
